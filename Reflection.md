## Development Process & AI Integration

### AI Tools Usage
- **Cursor & Copilot**
  - Used for repetitive code patterns and boilerplate
  - Assisted in component structure and basic styling
  - Helped with TypeScript type definitions
  - Accelerated development of standard UI patterns

### Manual Development & Decisions
- **Architecture & Design**
  - Designed the complete user flow and experience
  - Created the database schema and relationships
  - Defined the feature set and priorities
  - Established the project structure

- **Critical Thinking & Decision Making**
  - Implemented complex business logic for:
    - Link management system
    - User authentication flow
    - Data validation and error handling
    - State management architecture
  - Made architectural decisions about:
    - Server vs Client components
    - Data fetching strategies
    - Error handling patterns
    - Performance optimizations

### Future Improvements
With more time, I would enhance the application by:

1. **Link Management**
   - Implement drag-and-drop reordering
   - Add link categories and grouping
   - Enable link scheduling and expiration

2. **Customization**
   - Add theme customization options
   - Implement custom CSS injection
   - Create template system for quick setups

3. **Analytics & Insights**
   - Enhanced click tracking
   - Visitor analytics
   - Performance metrics

4. **User Experience**
   - Mobile app version
   - Social media integration
